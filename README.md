Dectionary with the help of API made in Html-Css-Javascript

I have Used api which is not that much good but its good for beginners who are learning.

API Link: https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/<word>

at the place of word you have to attach the query word for which you are finding meaning on web or taking input from user.
this is a very simple program which does not require any readMe file but still for formalities i had made this.

please give me feedback at telegram : @Mad_Mods.
